# Template for Project Documents

## Prologue

Briefly describe the main goal of the project.
Link to the corresponding project in Linear.

## Discussion

Explain the context for the project and identify the desired outcome.
Describe the product features and improvements that are in scope, as
well as any non-goals and future work.

### Goals

1. List primary goals for the project, in priority order.
2. Identify measurable (quantitative) and immeasurable (qualitative)
   indicators to monitor, both during and after the project.
3. Not too many.

### Non-goals

1. List areas that the project should not address.
2. These are as important and clarifying as the primary goals.

### Future considerations

1. List possible future projects or improvements that are out of
   scope.

## Approach

For product led projects, provide user interface and user experience
design resources relevant to the project. Describe key flows and provide
acceptance criteria. For engineering led projects, describe the proposed
approach in context to the overall architecture. Keep the document
up-to-date with changes.

### Key Flows

1. List process flows, user journeys, and acceptance criteria.

### Key Logic

1. List the rules that should guide design and engineering.
2. Be sure to consider both common and edge cases.
3. Focus on providing clear guidance rather than being exhaustive.

## Results

Describe the impact of the project upon completion, and return later to
reflect on the long-term results. Describe what went well, what was
changed over time, what was learned, and what went poorly.

## Changelog

1. List any changes to goals, approach, or logic and explain the change.
