## Discussion

This project aims to describe and build a minimum lovable product for
ground, an iOS app to track progress on the Groundhandling challenge.

2. Allow user to record the completion of an exercise
3. Internationalization support

### Non-goals

1. Features beyond the core experience of tracking challenge progress

### Future considerations

1. Record information about current weather for the location
2. Allow the user to record notes about the exercise
3. Allow the user to provide information about their gear
4. Local and global statistics

## Approach

UI/UX design in progress.

### Key Flows

* The date and time that the exercise was completed
* The location that the exercise was completed at

## Results
