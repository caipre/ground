# Write Project Documents

## Prologue

Write Project Documents to describe larger product, design, and
engineering work.

## Discussion

Following the [Linear method](https://linear.app/docs/linear-method),
we should prioritize working on projects:

> Projects define larger pieces of work that have a clear outcome or
> completion date, such as launching a new feature.
>
> https://linear.app/docs/projects

Project Documents are the product and design parallel of Decision
Records, which tend to be engineering focused. Decision Records
are written after a decision has been made and tend to be immutable;
Project Documents are written in advance of the work they describe and
are living documents until the project is completed or cancelled.

## Decision

* Write a project document to describe larger initiatives ([template])
* Crosslink the project document with the corresponding Linear project

## Consequences

Nothing to report.
