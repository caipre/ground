# Write Decision Records

## Prologue

We will write decision records to capture the context and consequences
of the choices that we make.

## Discussion

The start of a project is the ideal time to adopt practices that shape
the development of the project in the long-term. Writing a decision
record ensures that the thought process going into important choices is
not lost with time. New contributors are also able to the review
historical context of decisions. Writing decisions down does take a bit
of effort, but the benefits of putting thought to word are manifold.

Decision records should be specific to one issue and written concisely â€”
ideally not more than one page in length. The document is generally
immutable, except to make corrections, clarify statements, or add
results and reflections. Write a new document if a decision is
superseded, and maintain the _current_ practice in a strategy document.

## Decision

* Write a decision record to describe important decisions ([template])
* Review decision records periodically to reflect on their consequences
* Describe up-to-date solutions within evergreen strategy documents

## Consequences

* Prepared a template for and guidance on writing decision records
